// _.filter() filters through collections like loops, functional method for new set of values
// _.times() first arg is amount of times we want a function to run, second arg is the function
// _.keyBy() filters collection by returning the value of key passed in second arg, as obj value
// _.reduce() works similar to JS reduce, can take value for arg1, function for arg2
// _.join() converts elements in array into a string separated by string element in arg2
// _.nth() gets element at the index passed as arg2, if negative start from right to left
// _.max() computes maximum value of array
// _.range() creates an array of numbers ranging up to arg passed. if two args, arg1 is start
//_.forEach() works as for each loop but can return key and value
